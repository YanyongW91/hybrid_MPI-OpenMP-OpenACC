# hybrid_MPI-OpenMP-OpenACC

>**Our Goal**

This project aims to evaluate various algorithmic models, complex loop structures, and parallelization schemes commonly encountered in practical scientific codes. It employs a hybrid programming model integrating MPI, OpenMP, and OpenACC to maximize the utilization of computational resources on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. The objective is to address the challenges of large-scale scientific computations through the effective organization of massive parallelism, shared-memory models, and overlapping computations with communication or host-device operations.

>**Our Way**

The workflow proceeds as follows:\
$\quad$🐾&nbsp; i. Develop a serial CPU code to obtain correct results\
$\quad$🐾&nbsp; ii. Implement parallelization and conduct initial tests\
$\quad$🐾&nbsp; iii. Analyze theoretical or mathematical expressions to minimize redundant computations\
$\quad$🐾&nbsp; iv. Identify and address bottlenecks in memory and computations\
$\quad$🐾&nbsp;  v. Incorporate OpenACC (with CUDA as necessary)\
$\quad$🐾&nbsp; vi. Introduce OpenMP for host computations, if required\
$\quad$🐾&nbsp;vii. Iterate steps iii)–vi) to fully utilize hardware and technical resources, ensuring that no further theoretical simplifications are feasible for the implementation
